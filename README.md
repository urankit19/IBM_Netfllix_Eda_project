📊 IBM Netflix EDA Project

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
This analysis explores the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content trends, genres, release years, ratings, and country distributions using Python’s data analysis and visualization tools.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization on Netflix’s movie and TV show data.
By exploring patterns and relationships within the dataset, the analysis aims to answer questions such as:

How has Netflix’s content evolved over time?
